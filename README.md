# Progress Bar App
## By Johana Di Girolamo

This app was made so that a shape can work as a progress bar. With the text stored inside of the shape, we can keep track of:
1. **Current number**
	..* This number is what keeps track of your current standing. If you are attemping to measure percentages, then this number would be `70` for 70%, and in this case, the Goal number would have to be `100`.
2. **Goal number**
	..* This number is your final goal. If you are trying to measure number of interviews conducted, and your goal is 50, then this number would be `50`. The Current number will be your current standing and the percentage is automatically calculated.
3. **Maximum height/width of the shape**
	..* This number will be your maximum height or width of your shape. You have to measure this from the beginning so that the correct percentage is displayed.
