# Progress Bar App
### By Johana Di Girolamo


##Overview:
This app was made so that a shape can work as a progress bar. With the text stored inside of the shape, we can keep track of:
1. **Current number**
	- This number is what keeps track of your current standing. If you are attemping to measure percentages, then this number would be `70` for 70%, and in this case, the Goal number would have to be `100`.
2. **Goal number**
	- This number is your final goal. If you are trying to measure number of interviews conducted, and your goal is 50, then this number would be `50`. The Current number will be your current standing and the percentage is automatically calculated.
3. **Maximum height/width of the shape**
	- This number will be your maximum height or width of your shape. You have to measure this from the beginning so that the correct percentage is displayed.

## How it works:
1. You will want to select the shape of that in which you are trying to edit the dimensions/percentages for. Inside of this shape, it will store the 3 numbers mentioned above- _Current number, Goal number and Maximum height/width of the selected shape_
2. If this is your first time wanting to create this shape into a progress bar, **set it to it's 100% position (width & height), and click on the shape to refresh the selection**. Look at the SECOND box of text (see highlighted numbers in the image below). This is your **Maximum width/height for your shape**. _Note: this will display your CURRENT width, which is why you want to set your shape to your ideal 100% status._

3. Set your THIRD number in the text field to the maximum width. Example: `10/10/500` - `500` being the maximum width.
4. The first and the second number represent your percentage/progress. If you are tracking percentage, you may do `1/100/500`. If you are tracking other tasks, such as "Dogs walked this week", you can enter `4/25/500`.
